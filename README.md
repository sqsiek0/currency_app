# Current Info

## Introduction
This app shows the latest info about currency for example the average price of the currency to PLN, the date of the current price, and the graph that shows the last 30 days of changing price. It is a really simple app but you can get a lot of knowledge from it.

## Design
### 1. Lo-Fi
It is a low-fidelity design of how the app should look like. In designing such an app I focused on implementing things that would be intuitive to use and pretty. Despite its simple design app will be animated which will be shown in the Hi-Fi design.
